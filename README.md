# Tatua Ticketing App

This project is a simple ticketing application demonstrating three levels of client-side data persistence: **in-memory**, **sessionStorage**, and **localStorage**.

## Deployment

The project is deployed on GitHub Pages and can be accessed here:
[https://raddames-tonui.github.io/tatua-ticketing-app/session/index.html](https://raddames-tonui.github.io/tatua-ticketing-app/session/index.html)

## Features

* Ticket submission form with validation
* Responsive design and styling
* Data stored and managed with JavaScript objects and arrays
* Data persistence across three phases:

  * **In-memory**: Data stored temporarily in arrays
  * **Session storage**: Data persists until the browser session ends
  * **Local storage**: Data persists permanently in the browser
* Table view for submitted tickets
* Delete functionality for managing tickets

Each branch was merged into `main` after completion and testing.

## Technical Requirements Met

* Semantic HTML5 for structure
* CSS styling to match design
* Client-side form validation with feedback
* Clean, documented JavaScript for handling data and persistence
